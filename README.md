# Development Environments

A collection of development environments to bootstrap from, allowing a quick, 100% replicable setup which can be used across devices and projects.

1. Creates the required environment.
2. Uses NeoVim with suitable plugins.

## Why I need this?
1. Linux is great for development.
2. Windows is far better for gaming sessions, so I would like to run linux on a Windows PC exclusively for software development.
3. I switch between work & personal computers, so portability is necessary.

## How does it work?
1. Dockerfile supplies the development environment
2. Neovim and necessary plugins.
3. Create Docker file, run with project location mounted.
