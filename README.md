# Dev-anywhere

## What is this?
This project creates a portable programming environment, allowing a quick, 100% replicable setup that can be used across devices and projects.  

## Why I need this?
Linux is great for development. However, since Windows is far better for gaming sessions and I'm on a budget, let's try to create a linux-like experience on a Windows PC.

## How can this be accomplished?
Docker and Git. Also, since I heard that the cool engineers use Vim variants, I am exploring Neovim as the primary editing tool in this environment. Can't wait to show off my custom dev setup to folks.

### Current Status: WIP
